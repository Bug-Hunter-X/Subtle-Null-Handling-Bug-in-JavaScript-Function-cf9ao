# Subtle Null Handling Bug in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to null handling in a simple JavaScript function and provides a corrected version. The bug is not immediately obvious and can lead to unexpected results in certain edge cases.

## Bug Description

The original `foo` function handles null values correctly for direct comparison. However, it might exhibit unexpected behavior when one of the input parameters is a falsy value that's not strictly null (such as 0 or "").

## Solution

The solution includes a more robust approach that explicitly checks for null or undefined values using strict equality (`===`), ensuring accurate handling across different input types.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in a text editor or IDE.
3. Execute the JavaScript files using Node.js or a web browser's developer console.
